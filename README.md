# HT_Performance_Lab

## Overview

HT_Performance_Lab is a performance testing and benchmarking project designed to evaluate the efficiency of various tasks and applications. The project is structured into four distinct tasks, each encapsulated within its own directory and Python script (`master.py`). Each task is designed to test a specific aspect of performance, utilizing Python for its versatility and ease of use.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Circular Path

This task involves generating a circular path based on given parameters. It demonstrates the use of Python's list comprehension and modular arithmetic to create a sequence of numbers that represent a circular path.

### Task 2: Circle and Points Distance Calculation

Task 2 focuses on calculating the distances from a set of points to the center of a circle. It utilizes the numpy library for efficient numerical operations, showcasing the power of Python in scientific computing.

### Task 3: Report Generation

In this task, a report is generated based on test results and a predefined structure. It demonstrates the use of JSON for data interchange and Python's built-in JSON library for reading and writing JSON files.

### Task 4: Minimum Moves Calculation

Task 4 involves calculating the minimum number of moves required to align a set of numbers. It demonstrates basic Python operations and file handling, including reading from a file and handling exceptions.

## Setup and Usage

To run any of the tasks, navigate to the corresponding task directory and execute the `master.py` script with the appropriate command-line arguments. Each task's `master.py` script includes usage instructions and error handling for common issues such as incorrect arguments or file access permissions.
